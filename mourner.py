# 1.Generate a data set consisting of the length of each word used in the letter signed by A MOURNER. Be sure to disregard any text that uses
#       proper names, numbers, abbreviations, or titles.
# 2.Calculate the summary statistics for the letter's word lengths. Compare your findings with those of the known authors, and speculate about the identity of A MOURNER.
# 3.Compare the two Adams summaries. Discuss the viability of word-length analysis as a tool for resolving disputed documents.
# 4.What other information would be useful to identify A MOURNER?

#2 Most of the summary statistics that i calculated were closed to John Hancock's writing, my sample variance was much lower but our article was also much shorter.
    
    
#3 Both of Adams entries have very similar summary statistics, and he uses the highes range of word length of all the authors. Word-length analaysis probably works pretty well, because most authors have similar word usage in different passages.

#4 For this article specifically a longer text section would be helpful and would create more meaningful results. It would also be helpful to get comparable text from the same printer that the mourner text came from.
